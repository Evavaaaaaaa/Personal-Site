I want to 
1. change landing page -> with categories
2. change how categorize -> galleries (drawings), photographies, blogs
3. change the color
4. change the layout (especially the text)

why is abridge theme so fucking complicated ^ ^

1. i hope i can learn how to look at the html structure and compare to what i am writing to build
2. i hope to dynamically see the changes and not needing to zola serve everytime to see the changes... (Ali)
3. shortcode is not working. and i have no fucking idea where "src" and "sources" are stored. i guess i might need to build a new website on my own :) fuck
