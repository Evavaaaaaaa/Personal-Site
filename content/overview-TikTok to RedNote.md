Hi TikTok refugees, welcome to RedNote, a brand new quirky community you’d instantly fall in love to! 

To help more TikTok KOLs smoothly move in to our community, I decided to share some insights on how RedNote is different from TikTok. This report would cover the differences in many aspects: algorithm, user types and tools that could come handy.

If you find this article helpful, leave comments and support <3 

I’m looking forward for a more internationalized RedNote community!

# Algorithm: How to reach more users?

**User Engagement:** RedNote uses a specific calculation method called “CES” to determine if they like a particular post. If the user liked your post, you will gain 1 point. The same goes for collection. If the user commented your post, you will get a higher weightage - 4 points. And if the user followed you, you will get 8 points. The higher score you get, the more likely your post would be recommended to a broader audience.

**Search Keyword Matching:** RedNote recommendation algorithm pushes content based on keywords searched by users. When your post contains keywords that users search for, it is more likely to be recommended to those users. Therefore, when writing posts, use keywords strategically to increase the chances of being searched and recommended.

**Topic Relevance (hashtags):** On RedNote, users can create and follow different topics by hashtags. If your post is related to a popular topic, it is more likely to be recommended to users who follow that topic. Therefore, when writing posts, consider associating them with trending topics to increase visibility.

**Account Weight:** Account weight is another critical factor influencing content recommendations. Content from accounts with higher weight is more likely to be recommended to a larger audience. To gain more exposure on RedNote, improving your account’s weight is essential! 

# User types

RedNote has a very female-based community, with 70% of the users being female (CBN data, 2022). Additionally, the users are mostly from the Gen Z, ranging between 18 to 24 years old.

The user types could be roughly categorized into 4 types:

- The Gen Z: This group of users show interests in school study, games, fashion, hobbies, socials, and sports.
- The Work Elites: These users focus on financial independence, positivity, personality, and self growth.
- The Fashionists: They value fashion, workouts, cosmetics and outfits.
- The YOLO: They focus on life experiences and entertainment. Often then not, they also talk about philosophies of life. And they are usually the group that enjoy travelling abroad!

If you have more specific goals, such as boosting follower numbers instead of just increasing views, the pricing will also be higher.

# From TikTok to RedNote, what needs to be changed…

## 1. Including static content

TikTok heavily focuses on short videos. Although RedNote also supports short videos, static posts are also strong content type. Try to operate it like instagram account, where the posts could be either static or reels.

## 2. Understanding the keywords/trending topics

Most keywords are in mandarin, as most users search in mandarin. Try to include as many mandarin keywords as you could. Better, ask friends that speak mandarin to help you, as we RedNote community often have our own “slangs” that wouldn’t be translated by Google translation.

## 3. Engage in comment sections!

From the CES calculation, having comments under your posts mean the system would boost you to more audience. Mostly, RedNote users, being the Gen Z, are playful and love bantering around. So come interact with us!

That’s all I have for now! 

I hope you find this article helpful <3 

And have fun in RedNote!
