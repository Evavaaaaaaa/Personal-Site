# The Ivy Case System
"A framework is a structure, a system is a process"
## 1. Summarize the Question: wording matter
## 2. Verify the Objectives: ask for underlying Objectives
"One objective is ... Are there any other ojbectives that I should know about?"
## 3. Identify whether it is a number case
## 4. Ask broad, open-ended question: turn it into conversation and get a better gist
By asking open-ended questions, it would provide narrow information. And because as the case progressess, you'll lose your "right" to ask these broad question.
Some generic questions include:
- the company: public/private? how big is it? is it growing?
- the industry: where is the industry in its life cycle?
- the competition: internal (i.e. major players, market share) and external (i.e. substitutions, economy, interest rates, unemployment rate, price-cutting by competitors, rising material costs)
- the product: if a new product, ask about the advantages and disadvantages
## 5. Lay out structure: decision there
Sometimes, the structure is the answer itself.
Other times, how you reach that structure needs to be explained.
The structure is basically frameworks of different case types. This could be memorized and familiarized.

# Frameworks by case types
## New Market Entry
1. Current Market
- major players and market share
- product differentiation
- barriers to Entry
2. Entering
- if yes, how (start from scratch/acquisition/joint venture) - cost benefit analysis of each
- no

# Example Questions to Ask
## Market Entry
Does it fit into our overall strategy?
Where is it in its life cycle?
Who are the customers and how are they segmented?
What role does technology play in the industry and how quickly does it change?
How will the competition respond?
Who is our competition and what size market share does each competitor have?
How do their products and services differ from ours?
Are there substitutions available?
WHat are the risks? (PESTEL)
