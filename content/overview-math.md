Belief: What if I'm not good enough for this task? If I am smarter, better at memorizing the drugs, better at task management, I would be good enough and my manager would be happy.
Emotion: Anxiety, Scared, Unsettling

Rationale: Just finish it. Ask for feedback. Accept that I wouldn't "ace" it this time. Let's see how far I could go with what I have now. 
Change Emotion: This is the type of task I like. I am learning new things, and exporting the things I learn.

Work-wise:
1. I got the templates, framework and necessary information ready.
2. I have new ideas emerging every few seconds.
3. I need to build client-facing slides.

-> Conclustion: Time to condense. Stop searching for new information and work with what I have now.

Future thoughts:
1. Read scientific articles when I am not anxious. 
2. Learn to memorize.
